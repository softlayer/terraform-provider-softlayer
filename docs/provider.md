# SoftLayer Terraform Provider

Here is an example that will setup the following:
+ An SSH key resource.
+ A virtual server resource that uses an existing SSH key.
+ A virtual server resource using an existing SSH key and a Terraform managed SSH key (created as "test_key_1" in the example below).

(create this as sl.tf and run terraform commands from this directory):

```hcl
provider "softlayer" {
    username = ""
    api_key = ""
}

# This will create a new SSH key that will show up under the
# Devices>Manage>SSH Keys in the SoftLayer console.
resource "softlayer_ssh_key" "testkey1" {
    name = "testkey1"
    public_key = "${file("~/.ssh/id_rsa_test_key_1.pub")}"
    # Windows Example:
    # public_key = "${file("C:\ssh\keys\path\id_rsa_test_key_1.pub")}"
}

# Virtual Server created with existing SSH Key already in SoftLayer
# inventory and not created using this Terraform template.
resource "softlayer_virtual_guest" "host-a" {
    name = "host-a.example.com"
    domain = "example.com"
    ssh_keys = [123456]
    os_reference_code = "DEBIAN_7_64"
    datacenter = "ams01"
    network_speed = 10
    cpu = 1
    ram = 1024
}

# Virtual Server created with a mix of previously existing and
# Terraform created/managed resources.
resource "softlayer_virtual_guest" "host-b" {
    name = "host-b.example.com"
    domain = "example.com"
    ssh_keys = [123456, "${softlayer_ssh_key.test_key_1.id}"]
    os_reference_code = "CENTOS_6_64"
    datacenter = "ams01"
    network_speed = 10
    cpu = 1
    ram = 1024
}
```

You'll need to provide your SoftLayer username and API key,
so that Terraform can connect. If you don't want to put
credentials in your configuration file, you can leave them
out:

```hcl
provider "softlayer" {}
```

...and instead set these environment variables:

- **SOFTLAYER_USERNAME** or **SL_USERNAME**: Your SoftLayer username
- **SOFTLAYER_API_KEY** or **SL_API_KEY**: Your API key

You can also put credentials in _~/.softlayer_. See the [softlayer api python client docs](http://softlayer-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html) for details on this configuration file.
