## Additional notes

In SoftLayer, when user logins are deleted, there is a delay when that
login actually gets deleted in the SoftLayer backend systems. SoftLayer
successfully acknowledges the delete request and immediately updates the
user status to CANCEL_PENDING. Actual deletion of happens at some
unspecified amount of time in the future. This delay may be significant
especially during your projects testing phase. If you create a new user
login, and then delete it, and then create it again, you may receive an
error, as SoftLayer backend has not completely processed the previous delete
operation. If you do want to run through this create-delete-create-again
cycle again, you will have to specify a new globally unique username value
in your subsequent requests.
