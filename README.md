### Provider

Here is an example that will setup the following:
+ An SSH key resource.
+ A virtual server resource that uses an existing SSH key.
+ A virtual server resource using an existing SSH key and a Terraform managed SSH key (created as "test_key_1" in the example below).

(create this as sl.tf and run terraform commands from this directory):

```hcl
provider "softlayer" {
    username = ""
    api_key = ""
}

# This will create a new SSH key that will show up under the \
# Devices>Manage>SSH Keys in the SoftLayer console.
resource "softlayer_ssh_key" "testkey1" {
    name = "testkey1"
    public_key = "${file(\"~/.ssh/id_rsa_test_key_1.pub\")}"
    # Windows Example:
    # public_key = "${file(\"C:\ssh\keys\path\id_rsa_test_key_1.pub\")}"
}

# Virtual Server created with existing SSH Key already in SoftLayer \
# inventory and not created using this Terraform template.
resource "softlayer_virtual_guest" "host-a" {
    name = "host-a.example.com"
    domain = "example.com"
    ssh_keys = ["123456"]
    image = "DEBIAN_7_64"
    datacenter = "ams01"
    public_network_speed = 10
    cpu = 1
    ram = 1024
}

# Virtual Server created with a mix of previously existing and \
# Terraform created/managed resources.
resource "softlayer_virtual_guest" "host-b" {
    name = "host-b.example.com"
    domain = "example.com"
    ssh_keys = ["123456", "${softlayer_ssh_key.test_key_1.id}"]
    image = "CENTOS_6_64"
    datacenter = "ams01"
    public_network_speed = 10
    cpu = 1
    ram = 1024
}
```

You'll need to provide your SoftLayer username and API key,
so that Terraform can connect. If you don't want to put
credentials in your configuration file, you can leave them
out:

```
provider "softlayer" {}
```

...and instead set these environment variables:

- **SOFTLAYER_USERNAME**: Your SoftLayer username
- **SOFTLAYER_API_KEY**: Your API key

You can also put credentials in _~/.softlayer_. See the [softlayer api python client docs](http://softlayer-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html) for details on this configuration file.

##### Additional notes

In SoftLayer, when user logins are deleted, there is a delay when that
login actually gets deleted in the SoftLayer backend systems. SoftLayer
successfully acknowledges the delete request and immediately updates the
user status to CANCEL_PENDING. Actual deletion of happens at some
unspecified amount of time in the future. This delay may be significant
especially during your projects testing phase. If you create a new user
login, and then delete it, and then create it again, you may receive an
error, as SoftLayer backend has not completely processed the previous delete
operation. If you do want to run through this create-delete-create-again
cycle again, you will have to specify a new globally unique username value
in your subsequent requests.

#### `softlayer_ssh_key`

Provides SSK keys. This allows SSH keys to be created, updated and deleted.
For additional details please refer to [API documentation](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Security_Ssh_Key).

    certificate = <<EOF
[......] # cert contents
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
    EOF

    private_key = <<EOF
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
[......] # cert contents
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    EOF
}
```

##### Argument Reference

* `certificate` | *string*
    * (Required) The certificate provided publicly to clients requesting identity credentials.

#### `softlayer_objectstorage_account`

**Note:** For managing SoftLayer object storage *containers* and *objects*, please see the [Swift provider](/docs/providers/swift/index.html), since SoftLayer's object storage is an implementation of Swift object storage.

Ensures there is an existing object storage account within your SoftLayer account. If there is an existing object storage, it will learn its account name and keep it as its ID for future usage. If there is no object storage account, it will order one for you and remember the account name. It is not meant to be used for managing the life cycle of an object storage account in SoftLayer (e.g. update, delete) at this time.

```hcl
resource "softlayer_objectstorage_account" "foo" {
}
```

##### Argument Reference

No additional arguments needed.

##### Computed Fields

* `id` - The object storage account name, which you can later use with [Swift resources](/docs/providers/swift/index.html).

#### `softlayer_dns_domain`

The `softLayer_dns_domain` data type represents a single DNS domain record hosted on the SoftLayer nameservers. Domains contain general information about the domain name such as name and serial. Individual records such as `A`, `AAAA`, `CTYPE`, and `MX` records are stored in the domain's associated resource records using the  [`softlayer_dns_domain_record`](/docs/providers/softlayer/r/dns_records.html) resource.

```hcl
resource "softlayer_dns_domain" "dns-domain-test" {
    name = "dns-domain-test.com"
}
```

##### Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` | *string*
     * (Required) A domain's name including top-level domain, for example "example.com". _Name_ is the only field that needs to be set for `softlayer_dns_domain`. During creation the `NS` and `SOA` resource records are created automatically.

##### Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported

* `id` - A domain record's internal identifier.
* `serial` - A unique number denoting the latest revision of a domain.
* `update_date` - The date that this domain record was last updated.

#### `softlayer_dns_domain_record`

The `softlayer_dns_domain_record` data type represents a single resource record entry in a [`softlayer_dns_domain`](/docs/providers/softlayer/r/dns.html). Each resource record contains a `host` and `record_data` property, defining a resource's name and it's target data.

We are using [SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord)
SL's object for most of CRUD operations. Only for SRV record type we are using [SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord_SrvType](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord_SrvType) SL's object.

Currently we can CRUD almost all record types except _SOA_ type which is initially created on DNS create action.

##### `PTR` Record
######  _A note on creating `PTR` records:_

There are a lot of things that make the `PTR` record work properly, please review the [SLDN documentation](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord_PtrType/) regarding how they are to be implemented.

    host = "45"  # <- this is the last octet of IPAddress in the range of the subnet
    contact_email = "user@softlayer.com"
    ttl = 900
    record_type = "ptr"
}
```

##### Argument Reference

* `record_data` | *string*
    * (Required) The value of a domain's resource record. This can be an IP address or a hostname. Fully qualified host and domain name data must end with the "." character.
* `domain_id` | *int*
    * (Required) An identifier belonging to the domain that a resource record is associated with.
* `expire` | *int*
    * The amount of time in seconds that a secondary name server (or servers) will hold a zone before it is no longer considered authoritative.
* `host` | *string*
    * (Required) The host defined by a resource record. A value of `"@"` denotes a wildcard.
* `minimum_ttl` | *int*
    * The amount of time in seconds that a domain's resource records are valid. This is also known as a minimum TTL, and can be overridden by an individual resource record's TTL.
* `mx_priority` | *int*
    * Useful in cases where a domain has more than one mail exchanger, the priority property is the priority of the MTA that delivers mail for a domain. A lower number denotes a higher priority, and mail will attempt to deliver through that MTA before moving to lower priority mail servers. Priority is defaulted to 10 upon resource record creation.
* `refresh` | *int*
    * The amount of time in seconds that a secondary name server should wait to check for a new copy of a DNS zone from the domain's primary name server. If a zone file has changed then the secondary DNS server will update it's copy of the zone to match the primary DNS server's zone.
* `contact_email` | *string*
